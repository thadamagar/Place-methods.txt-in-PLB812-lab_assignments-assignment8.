Calling Genetic Variants with GATK1. Mark Duplicates* To mark the duplicate during the sequencing at first picard.jar is downloaded using wget command.* Bam file with duplicate mark and txt file with mark duplicate metrics has been created using  “java -jar picard.jar MarkDuplicates” command.2. Add Read Groups* To add read groups  “java -Xmx4g -jar picard.jar AddOrReplaceReadGroups” command was used.* This resulted in shorted.bam file which was used for downstream analysis.3. Call Variants with GATK* gatk was downloaded using wget command.* .zip file was then unzipped with unzip command.* gatk environment was created using “conda env create -f gatk-4.3.0.0/gatkcondaenv.yml”* gatk binary environment was copied to miniconda3 environment.* gatk jar file was copied to gakt environment.* gatk environment was activated.* for call variants gatk HaplotypeCaller was used resulted in .vcf file.
